1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
   Statistical significance of an insight can be assessed through hypothesis testing.
   The use of p-values to compare results to null hypothesis helps to determine wheter the results are due to change. 
2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
   Central Limit Theorem(CLT) is used when the sample size is large enough(more than 30). 
   Sample means will approximate normal distribution, regardless of the original data's distribution. 
   It is important because since it ensures reliable inferentail statistics. 
3. What is the statistical power?
   Statistical power is the ability of a test to correctly detect a true effect. 
   Having a high statistical power means having greater ability to identify significant results. 
4. How do you control for biases?
   Randomization, blinding, and using apropriate experimental designs to reduce skewed results can control biases. 
5. What are confounding variables?
   Confounding variables are factors that are linked to the independent and dependent variables, distorting the relationship between them. 
6. What is A/B testing?
    A/B testing compares two variants to see which performs better. 
7. What are confidence intervals?
   Confidence interval is a range that estimates the true value of a population parameter with a specified level of confidence.
