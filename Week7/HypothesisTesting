1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
   The statistical significance of an insight can be assessed through hypothesis testing.
   Using p-values to compare results to the null hypothesis helps determine whether the results are due to change. 
2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
   The Central Limit Theorem(CLT) is used when the sample size is large enough(more than 30). 
   Sample means will approximate normal distribution, regardless of the original data's distribution. 
   It is important because it ensures reliable inferential statistics. 
3. What is the statistical power?
   Statistical power is the ability of a test to detect a true effect correctly. 
   Having a high statistical power means having a greater ability to identify significant results. 
4. How do you control for biases?
   Randomization, blinding, and appropriate experimental designs to reduce skewed results can control biases. 
5. What are confounding variables?
   Confounding variables are factors that are linked to the independent and dependent variables, distorting the relationship between them. 
6. What is A/B testing?
    A/B testing compares two variants to see which performs better. 
7. What are confidence intervals?
   A confidence interval is a range that estimates the true value of a population parameter with a specified level of confidence.
